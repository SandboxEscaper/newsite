# newsite

managed to buy the domain sandboxescaper.com, as the previous owner didnt renew the domain (someone bought it in 2018.. probably for impersonation purposes).

google banned my blog.. so i will be maintaining a website instead.
sadly i cannot access all the technical writeups from my blog anymore since google removed it.
maybe in the future ill do some new writeups.. but probably not considering how hard people try to censor me from the internet.. not in the mood to give back to the community anymore.
